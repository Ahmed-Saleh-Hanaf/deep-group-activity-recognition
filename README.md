## Abstract

This repository provides a PyTorch reimplementation of the hierarchical deep temporal model proposed in CVPR 2016 for group activity recognition.
The model captures temporal dynamics at both the individual-person level and the group level using a two-stage LSTM architecture.
The implementation aims to
